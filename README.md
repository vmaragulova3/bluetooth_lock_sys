# Bluetooth Lock System
This project includes a prototype of the smart door lock. It consists of the LCD screen, RGB LED, a touch keypad, a servo, Adafruit Bluetooth LE UART Friend module, a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera V2, and a Raspberry Pi. To open the door with this lock, the user would have to know the correct password. If the combination is correct, the LED turns from red to green, and the lock opens up. The LCD screen shows the status of the lock. In this case, it will go from "locked" to "open." The camera captures the picture of the user and sends it via email for extra security measures.
