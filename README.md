# bluetooth_lock_sys
This project includes a prototype of the smart door lock. It consists of the LCD screen, RGB LED, a servo, bluetooth module, a camera, and a Raspberry Pi 3. To open the door with this lock, the user would have to know the correct password. If the combination is correct, the LED turns from red to green, and the lock opens up. The camera captures the picture of the user and sends it via email for extra security measures.
